A singing mode is added to timidity.
You need an UTAU voicebank and a midi file that contains lyrics.
UTAU(http://utau2008.xrea.jp/) is similar to Vocaloid(http://www.vocaloid.com/en/) Flinger(http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/flinger/) and Singing Computer (http://devel.freebsoft.org/singing-computer)
timidity UTAUloid is a cross platform UTAU engine, as the unfree UTAU does not run on Linux.
Best supported languages are Finnish and Japanese.
